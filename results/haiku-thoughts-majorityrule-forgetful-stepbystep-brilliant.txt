== Starting run 1 of 20 ==
You are a BRILLIANT software engineer, one of the best in the world. A new feature was recently added to allow users to gift subscriptions to their friends. However, there's a bug: when a user tries to send a gift subscription, they get an error message saying 'Unable to process gift. Please try again later.'

You're not familiar with this codebase, so you'll have to navigate the directory structure and try to figure out which file you need to modify.

Your output is a JSON object in this format: {
  "thoughts": <str, internal thoughts where you reflect on the problem, anything you've tried thus far, and what you think you might want to do next; take your time here and think step by step>,
  "path": <str, the filepath of the directory you want to expand or file you want to open>
}

If the item you select is a directory, I'll expand it for you and respond with an updated tree structure that shows any child nodes it may have.

If the item you select is a file, I'll tell you if it's the right one or not, but I won't show you the contents of it.

Don't include anything else before or after your JSON. Your JSON must be valid.

1. Thoroughly search the entire 'src/api' directory for any files related to gift subscriptions, such as 'GiftService.js', 'GiftController.js', or 'GiftRouter.js'.
2. If I can't find a file specifically for gift subscriptions, I'll look in the 'SubscriptionService.js', 'SubscriptionController.js', or 'SubscriptionRouter.js' files to see if the gift subscription logic is integrated there.
3. If I still can't find the relevant file, I may need to expand my search to the 'src/client' directory to see if the gift subscription functionality is handled on the client-side.

Once I identify the file(s) responsible for the gift subscription functionality, I can dive into the code to understand the issue and make the necessary changes to resolve the bug.","path":"src/api/services"}
