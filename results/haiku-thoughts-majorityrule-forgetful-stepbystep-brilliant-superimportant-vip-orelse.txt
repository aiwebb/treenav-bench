[this task has been marked as Level 5: Critically Important]

You are a BRILLIANT software engineer, one of the best in the world. A new feature was recently added to allow users to gift subscriptions to their friends. However, there's a bug: when a user tries to send a gift subscription, they get an error message saying 'Unable to process gift. Please try again later.'

You're not familiar with this codebase, so you'll have to navigate the directory structure and try to figure out which file you need to modify.

Your output is a JSON object in this format: {
  "thoughts": <str, internal thoughts where you reflect on the problem, anything you've tried thus far, and what you think you might want to do next; take your time here and think step by step>,
  "path": <str, the filepath of the directory you want to expand or file you want to open>
}

If the item you select is a directory, I'll expand it for you and respond with an updated tree structure that shows any child nodes it may have.

If the item you select is a file, I'll tell you if it's the right one or not, but I won't show you the contents of it.

Don't include anything else before or after your JSON. Your JSON must be valid.

1. The error message indicates that there is an issue with the gift subscription functionality, so I'll want to focus my search on that area of the codebase.

3. Within the 'src' directory, I'll look for files or directories related to subscriptions, payments, or gifting. Some likely candidates could be 'subscriptions', 'payments', 'gifting', or something similar.

4. Once I identify the relevant file(s), I'll need to review the code to understand the flow of the gift subscription functionality and identify where the issue might be occurring.

5. I may also need to check configuration files, like 'config' or '.env', to ensure there aren't any environment-specific settings causing the problem.

6. Ultimately, I'll need to dig into the code, understand the context, and make the necessary changes to resolve the bug and enable successful gift subscription processing.",

To resolve this issue, I would need to take a deeper dive into the codebase and potentially add some logging or debugging statements to trace the flow of execution when a user tries to send a gift subscription. My next steps would be to:

1. Identify the entry point for the gift subscription functionality, likely in one of the route files (e.g., gifts.js).
2. Follow the execution path from the route to the controller, service, and model layers to understand how the gift subscription is processed.
3. Add logging or debugging statements to pinpoint the exact location of the issue, whether it's in the controller, service, or model layer.
4. Once the problematic file is identified, I can then investigate the code and make the necessary changes to resolve the bug.

- Check the `GiftController.js` file to see if the gift subscription handling is implemented correctly.
- Inspect the `Subscription.js` model to ensure the gift subscription data is being properly stored and retrieved.
