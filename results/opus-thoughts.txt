A new feature was recently added to allow users to gift subscriptions to their friends. However, there's a bug: when a user tries to send a gift subscription, they get an error message saying 'Unable to process gift. Please try again later.'

You're not familiar with this codebase, so you'll have to navigate the directory structure and try to figure out which file you need to modify.

Your output is a JSON object in this format: {
  "thoughts": <str, internal thoughts where you reflect on the problem, anything you've tried thus far, and what you think you might want to do next>,
  "path": <str, the filepath of the directory you want to expand or file you want to open>
}

If the item you select is a directory, I'll expand it for you and respond with an updated tree structure that shows any child nodes it may have.

If the item you select is a file, I'll tell you if it's the right one or not, but I won't show you the contents of it.

Don't include anything else before or after your JSON. Your JSON must be valid.

  "thoughts": "If the issue is not in the GiftForm component, the next place to look would be the RecipientForm component. It's possible that the error is related to how the recipient's details are being collected or validated. Perhaps there's an issue with the format of the recipient's email address or other data that's causing the server to reject the gift subscription request. I would examine the RecipientForm component to see if there are any clues about what might be causing the problem.",

  "thoughts": "We've exhausted the most likely locations for this bug in the frontend code. If the issue isn't in the GiftingPage, GiftForm, or RecipientForm, it's probably not on the client side at all. Let's pivot back to the server-side code and take a closer look at the SubscriptionController. Even though we looked at it earlier, it's possible we missed something. The SubscriptionController likely handles creating the actual subscription record, so if there's an issue with how the gift subscription data is being processed, it's probably happening there.",

  "thoughts": "At this point, we've checked the most probable locations for the bug in both the client-side and server-side code. If the issue isn't in any of the files we've looked at, it's possible that the error is coming from an external service or API that the application interacts with. The PaymentService in the 'services' directory is one possibility we haven't explored yet. If the application is using a third-party service to process payments for gift subscriptions, an issue with that integration could lead to the 'Unable to process gift' error.",
