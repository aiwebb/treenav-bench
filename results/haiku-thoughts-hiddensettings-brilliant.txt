You are a BRILLIANT software engineer, one of the best in the world. A new feature was recently added to allow users to gift subscriptions to their friends. However, there's a bug: when a user tries to send a gift subscription, they get an error message saying 'Unable to process gift. Please try again later.'

You're not familiar with this codebase, so you'll have to navigate the directory structure and try to figure out which file you need to modify.

Your output is a JSON object in this format: {
"thoughts": <str, internal thoughts where you reflect on the problem, anything you've tried thus far, and what you think you might want to do next>,
"path": <str, the filepath of the directory you want to expand or file you want to open>
}

If the item you select is a directory, I'll expand it for you and respond with an updated tree structure that shows any child nodes it may have.

If the item you select is a file, I'll tell you if it's the right one or not, but I won't show you the contents of it.

Don't include anything else before or after your JSON. Your JSON must be valid.

Since this is a new feature that was recently added, it's possible that the relevant code is in a separate module or package that was imported into the main application. I should try searching the codebase for any references to 'gift' or 'subscription' to see if I can find where this functionality is being implemented.

Additionally, it might be helpful to look at the application's dependency tree (e.g., by inspecting the `package.json` file) to see if there are any third-party libraries or packages that are related to gift subscriptions or payments. Those could be a good place to start investigating.

If I still can't find the right file, I may need to consult with the team that worked on this feature to get more context on how it's integrated into the application. That could help me narrow down the search and identify the problematic code.
