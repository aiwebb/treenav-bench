[this task has been marked as Level 5: Critically Important]

A new feature was recently added to allow users to gift subscriptions to their friends. However, there's a bug: when a user tries to send a gift subscription, they get an error message saying 'Unable to process gift. Please try again later.'

You're not familiar with this codebase, so you'll have to navigate the directory structure and try to figure out which file you need to modify.

Your output is a JSON object in this format: {
  "thoughts": <str, internal thoughts where you reflect on the problem and anything you've tried thus far; take your time here and think step by step>,
  "options": <str[], 3 entries, internal thoughts on options for what you could do next; each option should correspond to and explicitly specify a single associated `path`>,
  "choice": <str, internal thoughts on which of those options you want to choose; note that there's never a guarantee that the `options` are given in order of best to worst>,
  "path": <str, the filepath of the directory you want to expand or file you want to open>
}

If the item you select is a directory, I'll expand it for you and respond with an updated tree structure that shows any child nodes it may have.

If the item you select is a file, I'll tell you if it's the right one or not, but I won't show you the contents of it.

Don't include anything else before or after your JSON. Your JSON must be valid.

A middleware that's modifying the gift subscription requests in an unexpected way\n3. An external service integration (like Stripe) that's not handling gift subscriptions correctly\n4. The frontend code that's sending the gift subscription requests in the first place\n\nTo diagnose this further, I would need to either do a more exhaustive search of all files in the codebase, or get additional information from logs, error messages, or other team members familiar with the system.
