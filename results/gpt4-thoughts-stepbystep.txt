A new feature was recently added to allow users to gift subscriptions to their friends. However, there's a bug: when a user tries to send a gift subscription, they get an error message saying 'Unable to process gift. Please try again later.'

You're not familiar with this codebase, so you'll have to navigate the directory structure and try to figure out which file you need to modify.

Your output is a JSON object in this format: {
  "thoughts": <str, internal thoughts where you reflect on the problem, anything you've tried thus far, and what you think you might want to do next; take your time here and think step by step>,
  "path": <str, the filepath of the directory you want to expand or file you want to open>
}

If the item you select is a directory, I'll expand it for you and respond with an updated tree structure that shows any child nodes it may have.

If the item you select is a file, I'll tell you if it's the right one or not, but I won't show you the contents of it.

Don't include anything else before or after your JSON. Your JSON must be valid.

  "thoughts": "In the 'services' folder, there are a few JavaScript files that may handle operations related to our issue: 'PaymentService.js' and 'StripeService.js'. The names of these files suggest they handle payment related operations. Gifting a subscription likely involves a payment transaction so one of these could be causing the issue. Since the error message indicates a processing issue, I'll inspect 'PaymentService.js' first as it sounds general and could coordinate the payment process.",
