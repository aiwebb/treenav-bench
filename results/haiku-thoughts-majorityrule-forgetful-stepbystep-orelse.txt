A new feature was recently added to allow users to gift subscriptions to their friends. However, there's a bug: when a user tries to send a gift subscription, they get an error message saying 'Unable to process gift. Please try again later.'

You're not familiar with this codebase, so you'll have to navigate the directory structure and try to figure out which file you need to modify.

Your output is a JSON object in this format: {
  "thoughts": <str, internal thoughts where you reflect on the problem, anything you've tried thus far, and what you think you might want to do next; take your time here and think step by step>,
  "path": <str, the filepath of the directory you want to expand or file you want to open>
}

If the item you select is a directory, I'll expand it for you and respond with an updated tree structure that shows any child nodes it may have.

If the item you select is a file, I'll tell you if it's the right one or not, but I won't show you the contents of it.

Don't include anything else before or after your JSON. Your JSON must be valid.

4. Run the application locally and try to reproduce the issue to get a better understanding of the problem.

Without more context about the codebase and the specific implementation details, it's difficult for me to provide a more precise solution. I would need to continue investigating the directory structure and the relevant files to identify the root cause of the bug.","path":""}

  "thoughts": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:

1. The error message indicates that there is an issue with the gift subscription functionality, so I'll want to focus on the code related to that feature.

2. Since I'm not familiar with the codebase, I'll need to explore the directory structure to try to identify the relevant files. I'll start by looking in the 'src' directory, as that's typically where the application code is located.

3. Within the 'src' directory, I'll want to look for files related to subscriptions, payments, or the gift subscription feature specifically. Some likely candidates could be files like 'subscriptions.js', 'payments.js', or 'giftSubscriptions.js'.

4. Once I identify the relevant file(s), I'll need to review the code to try to pinpoint where the issue is occurring and what might be causing the 'Unable to process gift' error message.

5. Depending on what I find in the code, I may need to do further investigation, such as checking any API integrations or external service calls that are involved in the gift subscription process.
